# 📚 RAG-Based PDF QA System

![RAG](https://img.shields.io/badge/RAG-Retrieval--Augmented--Generation-blue)  
A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that allows users to query PDF documents using **DeepSeek**, **Groq API**, and **FAISS** for efficient vector search. This system enhances traditional language models by incorporating document retrieval to provide more accurate, context-aware answers.

## 🧠 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?  
RAG is an advanced AI technique that combines **retrieval-based search** with **generative AI models**. Instead of relying purely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG dynamically fetches relevant documents (e.g., PDFs) and uses them as context to generate responses. This ensures:
- **More accurate answers** based on up-to-date information
- **Better context understanding** by grounding responses in real documents
- **Improved scalability** for enterprise applications

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Upload PDFs** and extract text automatically  
✅ **Vectorize documents** using **FAISS** for efficient retrieval  
✅ **Query system** via a user-friendly Streamlit UI  
✅ **Integrates with DeepSeek & Groq API** for accurate response generation  
✅ **Fast & scalable** with optimized embeddings
